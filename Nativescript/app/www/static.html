            Chapter 4: Spacetime
        </h1>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0826">In the previous chapters we followed the historical road to relativity, and in fact our reasoning was not too far from what Einstein originally presented.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0827">We have been forced to accept that space is not the great stage upon which the events of our lives are played out.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0828">Likewise, time is not something universal and absolute.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0829">Instead we moved toward a picture of space and time that is much more malleable and subjective.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0830">The great clock in the sky, and in some sense the sky itself, has been banished.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0831">It might feel to us like the world is a box within which we go about our business, because that picture allows us to make sense of it quickly and efficiently.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0832">The ability to map the movement of things against an imaginary grid is what we might call spatial awareness, and it is clearly important if you are to avoid predators, catch food, and survive in a dangerous and challenging environment.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0833">But there is no reason why this model, buried deep within our brains and reinforced over millions of years by natural selection, should be anything other than a model.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0834">If a way of thinking about the world confers a survival advantage, then that way of thinking will become ubiquitous.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0835">58</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0836">The scientific correctness of it is irrelevant.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0837">The important thing is that, because we chose to accept the results of experiments conducted on Faraday's mottled benchtop and the explanations codified by Maxwell, we have acted like scientists and rejected the comfortable model of space and time that allowed our ancestors to survive and prosper on the ancient plains of Africa.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0838">This model has been embedded and reinforced deep within our psyche by our experiences over many millions of years, and discarding it may well be disorientating.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0839">That dizzying feeling of confusion, if (hopefully) followed by an epiphany of clarity, is the joy of science.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0840">If the listener is feeling the former, we hope to deliver the latter by the end of the book.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0841">This is not a history book.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0842">Our aim is to describe space and time in the most enlightening way we can, and it is our view that the historical road to relativity does not necessarily provide the best path to enlightenment.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0843">From a modern perspective, over a century after Einstein's revolution, we have learned that there is a deeper and more satisfying way to think about space and time.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0844">Rather than dig any deeper into the old-fashioned textbook view, we are going to start again from a blank canvas.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0845">In so doing we will come to understand what Minkowski meant when he said that space and time must be merged together into a single entity.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0846">Once we have developed a more elegant picture, we will be well placed to achieve our principal goal � we shall be able to derive E=mc<sup>2</sup>.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0847">Here is the starting point.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0848">Einstein's theories can be constructed almost entirely using the language of geometry.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0849">That is, you don't need much algebra, just pictures and concepts.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0850">At the heart of the matter, there lie only three concepts: invariance, causality, and distance.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0851">59</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0852">Unless you are a physicist, two of these will probably be unfamiliar words, and the third familiar but, as we shall see, subtle.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0853">Invariance is a concept that lies at the core of modern physics.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0854">Glance out at the world now, then turn around and look in the opposite direction.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0855">Your room will look different from different vantage points, of course, but the laws of nature are the same.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0856">It doesn't matter whether you are pointing north, south, east, or west, gravity still has the same strength and still keeps your feet on the ground.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0857">Your TV still works when you spin it around, and your car still starts whether you've left it in London, Los Angeles, or Tokyo.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0858">These are all examples of invariance in nature.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0859">When put like this, invariance seems like little more than a statement of the obvious.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0860">But imposing the requirement of invariance on our scientific theories proves to be an astonishingly fruitful thing to do.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0861">We have just described two different forms of invariance.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0862">The requirement that the laws of nature will not change if we spin around and determine them while facing different directions is called rotational invariance.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0863">The requirement that the laws will not change if we move from place to place is called translational invariance.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0864">These seemingly trivial requirements turned out to be astonishingly powerful in the hands of Emmy Noether, whom Albert Einstein described as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0865">In 1918 Noether published a theorem that revealed a deep connection between invariance and the conservation of particular physical quantities.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0866">We will have more to say about conservation laws in physics later on, but for now let us just state the deep result Noether discovered.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0867">For the specific example of looking at the world in different directions, if the laws of nature remain unchanged irrespective of the direction in which we are facing, then there exists a quantity that is conserved.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0868">60</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0869">In this case, the conserved quantity is called angular momentum.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0870">For the case of translational invariance, the quantity is called momentum.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0871">Why should this be important?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0872">Let's pull an interesting physics fact out of the metaphorical hat and explain it.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0873">The moon moves 4 centimeters farther away from the earth every year.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0874">Why?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0875">Picture the moon in your mind's eye as being stationary above the surface of the spinning earth.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0876">The water in the oceans directly beneath the moon will bulge out a tiny bit toward the moon because the moon's gravity is pulling it, and the earth will rotate once a day beneath this bulge.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0877">This is the cause of the ocean tides.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0878">There is friction between the water and the surface of the earth, and this friction causes the earth's rate of spin to slow down.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0879">The effect is tiny but measurable; the earth's day is gradually lengthening by approximately two-thousandths of a second per century.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0880">Physicists measure the rate of spin using angular momentum, so we can say that the angular momentum of the earth is reducing over time.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0881">Noether tells us that because the world looks the same in every direction (to be more precise, the laws of nature are invariant under rotations), then angular momentum is conserved, which means that the total amount of spin must not change.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0882">So what happens to the angular momentum the earth loses by tidal friction?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0883">The answer is that it is transferred to the moon, which speeds up in its orbit around the earth to compensate for the slowing down of the earth's rotation.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0884">This causes it to drift slightly farther away from the earth.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0885">61</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0886">In other words, to ensure that the total angular momentum of the earth and moon system is conserved, the moon must drift into a wider orbit around the earth to compensate for the fact that the earths rate of spin is slowing down.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0887">This is a very real and quite fantastic effect.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0888">The moon is big, and it is drifting farther away from the earth as every year goes by to conserve angular momentum.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0889">Italian novelist Italo Calvino found it so wonderful that he wrote a short story called "The Distance of the Moon," in which he imagined a time in the distant past when our ancestors could sail each night across the ocean in boats to meet the setting moon and clamber onto its surface using ladders.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0890">As the moon drifted farther away over the years, there came a night when the moon lovers had to make a choice between becoming trapped on the moon forever or returning to Earth.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0891">This surprising and, in the hands of Calvino, strangely romantic phenomenon has its explanation in the abstract concept of invariance and the deep connection between invariance and the conservation of physical quantities.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0892">It is difficult to overstate the importance of the idea of invariance in modern science.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0893">At the heart of physics is the desire to produce an intellectual framework that is universal and in which the laws are never a matter of opinion.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0894">As physicists, we aim to uncover the invariant properties of the universe because, as Noether well knew, these lead us to real and tangible insights.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0895">Identifying the invariant properties is far from easy, however, because nature's underlying simplicity and beauty are often hidden.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0896">Nowhere in science is this truer than in modern particle physics.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0897">Particle physics is the study of the subatomic world; the quest for the fundamental building blocks of the universe and the forces of nature that stick them together.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0898">62</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0899">We have already met one of the fundamental forces, electromagnetism.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0900">Understanding it led us to an explanation for the nature of light that has launched us on the road to relativity.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0901">In the subatomic world there are two other forces of nature that hold sway.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0902">The strong nuclear force sticks the atomic nucleus together at the heart of the atom, and the weak nuclear force allows stars to shine and is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay; the use of radiocarbon dating to measure the age of things, for example, relies on the weak nuclear force.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0903">The fourth force is gravity, the most familiar perhaps, but by far the weakest.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0904">Our best theory of gravity today is still Einstein's general theory of relativity and, as we shall see in the final chapter, it is a theory of space and time.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0905">These four forces act between just twelve fundamental particles to build everything in the world we can see, including the sun, moon, and stars, all the planets in our solar system, and indeed our own bodies.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0906">This all constitutes an astonishing simplification of what at first glance appears to be an almost infinitely complicated universe.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0907">Glance out your window.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0908">You may be faced with the distorted reflections of a city, as the afternoon light scatters off sheets of steel and glass, or black and white cattle grazing in neatly fenced green fields.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0909">But whether cityscape or farmland, the most astonishing thing about practically every window view in the world is the evidence of human intervention.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0910">Our civilization is all-pervasive, and yet twenty-first-century physics tells us that, at its heart, it is all a mathematical dance involving a handful of subatomic particles, organized by only four forces of nature over 13.7 billion years.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0911">The complexity of human brains and the products of the powerful synthesis between consciousness and dexterous skill that we glimpse outside our windows mask the underlying simplicity and elegance of nature.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0912">63</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0913">The scientist's task is to hunt for those properties that act as a Rosetta stone, to allow us to decipher the language of nature and reveal its beauty.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0914">The tool that allows us to search for and exploit these properties of nature is mathematics.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0915">In itself, this is a sentence that throws up deep questions, and entire books have been written attempting to advance plausible reasons as to why it may be so.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0916">Quoting Eugene Wigner again: "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve."</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0917">Perhaps we will never understand the true nature of the relationship between mathematics and nature, but history has shown that mathematics allows us to organize our thinking in a way that proves to be a reliable guide to a deeper understanding.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0918">As we have been at pains to emphasize, to proceed in this spirit, physicists write down equations, and equations do nothing more than express relationships between different real-world "things."</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0919">An example of an equation is speed = distance/time, which we met in the last chapter when we were discussing light clocks: in symbols v = x/t, where v is the speed, x is the distance traveled, and t is the time taken to travel the distance x.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0920">Very simply, recall that if you travel 60 miles in 1 hour, then you have traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0921">Now, the most interesting equations will be those that are capable of furnishing a description of nature that is agreed upon by everyone.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0922">That is, they should deal <i>only</i> in invariant quantities.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0923">We could all then agree on what we are measuring, irrespective of our perspective in the universe.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0924">64</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0925">According to common sense, the distance between any two points in space is such an invariant quantity, and pre-Einstein it was.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0926">But we saw in the previous chapter that it is no such thing.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0927">Remember: Common sense is not always reliable.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0928">Similarly, the passage of time has become a subjective thing and it varies depending on how fast clocks are moving relative to each other.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0929">Einstein has upset the order of things, and we cannot even rely on distance and time to build a reliable picture of the universe.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0930">From the point of view of a physicist looking for the deep laws of nature, the equation v = x/t is therefore of no fundamental use, because it does not express a relationship between invariant quantities.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0931">By undermining space and time, we have shaken the very foundations of physics.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0932">What, then, are we to do?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0933">One option is to try and reestablish order by making a conjecture.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0934">Conjecture is a fancy word for "guess," and scientists do it all the time � there are no prizes for how smart we are in figuring out the underlying theory; a successful educated guess will do just fine so long as it agrees with experiment.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0935">The conjecture is radical: <i>Space and time can be merged into a single entity that we call "spacetime," and distances in spacetime are invariant</i>.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0936">This is a bold assertion and its content will become clearer as we go.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0937">When you think about it for a moment, it is perhaps less bold than it seems at first sight.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0938">If we are to lose the age-old certainties of absolute, unvarying distances in space and the unchanging tick-tock of time as the great clock in the sky marks the passing of the years, then maybe the only thing to do is to search for some kind of unification of the two seemingly separate concepts.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0939">65</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0940">Therefore, our immediate challenge is to search for a new measure of distance in spacetime that does <i>not</i> change depending on how we move around relative to each other.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0941">We will need to tread carefully to understand how the spacetime synthesis works.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0942">But what exactly does it mean to search for a distance in spacetime?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0943">Suppose I get out of bed at 7 a.m. and finish my breakfast at 8 a.m.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0944">The following statements are true given what we know from experiment: (1) I may measure the distance in space from my bed to my kitchen to be 10 meters, but someone whizzing by at high speed will measure a different distance; (2) My watch indicates that I took 1 hour to eat breakfast, but the high-speed observer will record a different time.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0945">Our conjecture is that the distance in <i>spacetime</i> between my getting out of bed and my finishing breakfast is something we can all agree upon � i.e., it is invariant.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0946">The existence of this consensus is crucial because we want to build up a set of natural laws using only this type of object.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0947">Of course, we just guessed that this might be how things are and we certainly haven't proven anything yet.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0948">We haven't even decided how to calculate distances in spacetime.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0949">But to proceed further, we must first explain what is meant by the second of our three key words, <i>causality</i>.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0950">Causality is another seemingly obvious concept whose application will have profound consequences.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0951">It is simply the requirement that cause and effect are so important that their order cannot be reversed.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0952">Your mother caused your birth, and no self-consistent picture of space and time should allow you to be born before your mother.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0953">To construct a theory of the universe in which you could be born first would be nonsense and lead to contradictions.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0954">66</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0955">When put in these terms, nobody could argue with the requirement of causality.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0956">It is worth reflecting, however, that humans seem capable of ignoring it on a daily basis.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0957">Take prophesy, for example.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0958">Figures like Nostradamus are revered to this day for allegedly being able to see events that happen in the future, either in dreams or some other mystical trancelike state.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0959">In other words, events that happened centuries after Nostradamus' death were visible in his lifetime, at least to him.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0960">Nostradamus died in 1566, but he is credited with observing the Great Fire of London in 1666, the rise of Napoleon and Hitler, the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, and, our own personal favorite, the rise of the Antichrist in Russia in 1999.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0961">The Antichrist hasn't appeared yet but perhaps he/she is still rising and if he/she does appear before this book is published, then we stand corrected.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0962">Putting amusing drivel aside, we need to introduce some important terminology.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0963">Nostradamus's death was an "event," as were the birth of Adolf Hitler and the Great Fire of London.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0987">To get warmed up we will set time to one side for the moment and think about the idea of distance in ordinary three-dimensional space, a concept with which we are all familiar.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0989">As will be very familiar to anyone who has flown on a long-haul flight and watched her progress on the map on the aircraft entertainment system, the shortest distance between any two points on the earth's surface appears as a curve.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0993">The message is clear: Straight lines represent the shortest distance between two points only in flat space.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0994">The geometry of flat space is often called Euclidean geometry.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0995">What Euclid didn't know at the time, however, and in fact it did not become clear until the nineteenth century, was that his geometry of flat space is only a specific example of a whole family of different possible geometries, each of which are mathematically consistent and some of which can be used to describe nature.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0996">A very good example is the surface of the earth, which is curved and therefore described using a geometry that is non-Euclidean.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0997">Specifically, the shortest distance between two points is not a Euclidean straight line.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0998">There are other familiar Euclidean properties that are not obeyed on the surface of the earth.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_0999">For example, the interior angles of a triangle no longer add up to 180 degrees, and lines that are parallel and point north-south at the equator cross at the poles.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1002">Now we would be correctly accounting for the curvature of the earth.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1003">An airline pilot could stretch a piece of string between two cities on the globe, measure its length with a ruler, and then simply multiply the answer by the ratio in size of the globe and the earth.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1005">In either case, we need to do better than a piece of string and figure out an equation that tells us the distance between any two points on the earth's surface given only their latitude and longitude, and the shape and size of the earth.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1009">It does, however, allow one to calculate the shortest distance between two points on a sphere, in much the same way that Pythagoras' theorem is a recipe for calculating the shortest distance between two points (the hypotenuse) on a tabletop if we know the distances from one corner as measured along the edges of the table.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1010">Since straight lines belong in the domain of Euclid, we shall introduce a new term for the shortest distance between two points that applies whether the space is curved or flat.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1011">This line is called a geodesic: A great circle is a geodesic on the surface of the earth and a straight line is a geodesic in flat space.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1266">If it's 2 seconds in the future, then it must travel a distance c � 2 seconds.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1267">In other words, it must travel at the speed c.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1270">Conversely, for any events that lie between the 45-degree lines but in the upper and lower wedges, it is possible to communicate between them and the event at O using signals that travel at speeds slower than c.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1271">We have finally managed to interpret the speed c: It is the cosmic speed limit.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1272">Nothing can travel faster than c because if it did it could be used to transmit information that could violate the principle of cause and effect.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1273">Notice also that if everyone is to agree on the distance in spacetime between any two events, then they must also agree that the cosmic speed limit is c, regardless of how they are moving around in spacetime.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1274">The speed c therefore has an additional interesting property: No matter how two different observers are moving, they must always measure c to be the same.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1275">The speed c is beginning to look a lot like another special speed we have encountered in this book: the speed of light, but we haven't proved the connection yet.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1287">This is the principle we established right at the start of the book.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1288">It is not possible to define who is moving and who is standing still, and therefore it is perfectly acceptable for you, seated on a train, to decide that you are not moving.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1290">Since your journey takes two hours, then, from your perspective, you have traveled only in time.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1291">In spacetime, therefore, you have traveled distance s given by s = ct where t = 2 hours (because the distance in space as measured by you is x = 0).</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1292">That is all straightforward.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1293">Now consider your journey from the standpoint of your friend, who is not on the train but who instead is sitting on the ground somewhere (it does not matter where he actually is, just that he is at rest relative to the earth while you are whizzing by on the train).</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1294">Your friend would prefer to measure times using his own wristwatch and distances relative to himself.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1295">To simplify things a little bit, let us suppose your train journey is on a perfectly straight track.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1296">If you travel for 2 hours at a speed of v = 100 miles per hour, then your friend notes that, at the end of the journey, you have traveled a distance X = vT.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1297">We are using capital letters when we talk about distances or times measured by your friend in order to distinguish them from the corresponding quantities measured by you (i.e., x = 0 and t = 2 hours).</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1298">So, according to your friend, you have traveled a spacetime distance s given by s<sup>2</sup> = (cT)<sup>2</sup> - (vT)<sup>2</sup>.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1299">Here is the crucial part of the whole argument: You must both agree on the spacetime distance of your journey.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1300">According to your measurements, you did not move (x = 0) and your journey took 2 hours (t = 2 hours), while your friend says that you have traveled a distance of vT (where v = 100 miles per hour) and your journey takes a time T.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1308">Then, we were motivated to think about light clocks because Maxwell's brilliant synthesis of the experimental results of Faraday and others strongly suggested that the speed of light should be the same for all observers.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1309">This conclusion was supported by the experimental work of Michelson and Morley, and taken at face value by Einstein.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1311">We didn't even need to give light a special role.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1312">Instead, we introduced space-time and, as a result, insisted that there should exist the notion of an invariant distance between events.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1321">How are we to picture spacetime?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1322">Real spacetime is four-dimensional but the four-dimensional nature poses a stumbling block to our imagination, because human brains cannot directly picture objects in higher than three dimensions.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1323">In addition, the fact that time makes up one of the dimensions just sounds plain weird.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1324">A picture that might help make it all a little less mystical is to imagine a motorcycle roaming over an undulating countryside.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1325">Roads criss-cross the landscape, allowing our motorcyclist to wander this way and that.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1326">Spacetime is rather like the rolling countryside.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1327">The analogue of our motorcyclist traveling due north might be an object moving only in the time direction through spacetime.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1328">In other words, the object would be stationary in space.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1329">Of course, statements like "stationary in space" are subjective and so it is to be understood that the identification of "due north" with "the time direction" implies a particular point of view, but that is okay; we just need to bear it in mind.</span>

		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1331">Now, the roads criss-crossing the spacetime landscape are all restricted to lie within a bearing of 45 degrees of north; roads due east and west are disallowed because to travel along them our spacetime "motorcyclist" would have to exceed the cosmic speed limit through space.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1332">Think of it this way: If the motorcyclist could travel due east, then he could go as far as he wanted in the easterly direction without any time passing at all, because he would not travel any distance up the northerly time direction.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1333">This would correspond to an infinite speed through space; he would get from a to b instantaneously.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1334">The roads have therefore been built so that the motorcyclist cannot travel too fast in an easterly or westerly direction.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1335">The analogy can be pushed even further.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1336">We will very soon show that everything moves over spacetime at the same speed.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1337">It is just as if our motorcyclist has a device that fixes the throttle on his bike so that he always travels at the same speed over the spacetime landscape.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1338">We do need to be a little bit careful here, for when we talk about a speed in spacetime, it is not the same as a speed through space.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1339">A speed through space can be anything provided it does not exceed the cosmic speed limit � e.g., our motorcyclist might take a road close to a bearing of northeast, and in doing so he would be pushing as close to the cosmic speed limit as he could.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1340">In contrast, a road bearing close to due north would not lead to much movement east or west and consequently a journey that is well within the speed limit.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1341">The statement that everything moves at the same speed through spacetime sounds rather profound and perhaps a little baffling.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1342">It means that as you sit listening to this book you are whizzing over the spacetime landscape at exactly the same speed as everything else in the universe.</span>

		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1344">Viewed like that, motion through space is a shadow of a more universal motion through spacetime.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1345">In a very real sense, as we will now show, you are exactly like the motorcyclist with the fixed throttle.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1346">You are moving over the spacetime landscape with your throttle fixed open as you listen to this book.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1347">Because you are sitting still, your journey is entirely up the northerly time road.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1348">If you glance at your watch, you'll see the distance in time ticking by.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1349">This is a very strange-sounding claim, so let's go through it carefully.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1350">Why does everything move at the same speed through space-time?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1351">Consider our motorcyclist again and imagine 1 second passes according to the watch on his wrist.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1352">In that time, he will have traveled through spacetime by a certain distance.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1353">But everyone must agree on how far that distance is, because distances in spacetime are universal and not a matter for debate.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1354">That means we can ask the motorcyclist how far he thinks he has traveled over the spacetime landscape and the answer he gives will be the right answer.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1355">Now, the motorcyclist can choose to calculate distances in spacetime relative to himself, and from this point of view he has not moved in space.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1356">It is just like the person sitting on the airplane in Chapter 1 who doesn't stray from her airplane seat and who therefore states that she has not moved.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1357">She may have moved relative to someone else � for example, someone standing on the ground watching the plane fly by � but that is not the point.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1358">So from our motorcyclist's point of view, he has not moved in space and yet 1 second in time has passed.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1359">He can therefore use the spacetime distance equation s<sup>2</sup> = (ct)<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> with x = 0 (because he hasn't moved in space) and t = 1 second to figure out how far in spacetime he has actually traveled: The answer is a distance equal to c multiplied by 1 second.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1360">95</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1361">So the motorcyclist tells us that he is traveling a distance of c (multiplied by 1 second) for every second that passes on his watch, and that is just another way of saying that his speed through spacetime is equal to c.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1362">If you have been following closely, then you might object that the passage of 1 second was measured on the motorcyclist's wristwatch and that a different amount of time will pass according to someone else who is moving relative to the motorcyclist.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1363">That is true enough, but there is something special about the motorcyclist's watch, because the motorcyclist does not move relative to himself (a trivial statement).</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1364">We are therefore free to put x = 0 in the distance equation and so the time that passes on his wristwatch is a direct way to measure the spacetime distance s.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1365">This is a nice result: The time that passes on the motorcyclist's watch is equal to the spacetime distance traveled divided by c.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1366">In a sense, his watch is a device for measuring distances in spacetime.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1367">Since both the spacetime distance and c are agreed upon by everyone, it follows that the motorcyclist has unwittingly used his watch to measure something that everyone can agree upon.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1368">The space-time speed c that he deduces is therefore also a quantity that everyone can agree upon.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1369">So the speed through spacetime is a universal upon which everyone agrees.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1370">This newfound way of thinking about how things move through spacetime can help us get a different handle on why moving clocks run slow.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1371">In this spacetime way of thinking, a moving clock uses up some of its fixed quota of spacetime speed because of its motion through space and that leaves less for its motion through time.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1372">In other words, a moving clock doesn't move so fast through time as a stationary one, which is just another way of saying that it ticks more slowly.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1373">96</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1374">In contrast, a clock sitting at rest whizzes along in the time direction at the speed c with no motion through space.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1375">It therefore ticks along as fast as is possible.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1376">Armed with spacetime, we are ready to contemplate one of the wonderful puzzles of Special Relativity: the Twins Paradox.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1377">Earlier in the book we showed that Einstein's theory allows us to contemplate the possibility of traveling to distant places in the universe.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1378">Speeding within a whisker of the speed of light, we imagined journeying off to the Andromeda galaxy within a human lifetime regardless of the fact that it takes light nearly 3 million years to make the journey.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1379">There is a paradox lurking here that we previously glossed over.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1380">Imagine twins, one of whom trains to be an astronaut and heads off on humanity's first mission to Andromeda, leaving her twin back home on Earth.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1381">The astronaut twin is moving at high speed relative to the earth and consequently her life slows down relative to her twin on Earth.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1382">But we have just spent a significant fraction of this book arguing that there is no such thing as absolute motion.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1383">In other words, the answer to the question "Who is doing the moving?" is "Whoever you want."</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1384">Anybody and everybody is free to decide that they are standing still, and the other guy is whizzing around the universe at high speed relative to them.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1385">And so it is for the astronaut twin, who is free to say that she is standing perfectly still in her space rocket, watching the earth fly away at high speed.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1386">For her, it is therefore the earthbound twin who ages more slowly.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1387">Who is right?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1388">Can it really be that each of the twins ages more slowly relative to the other?</span>

		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1391">There is no paradox yet, because any problems you might be having in believing that each twin observes the other to be aging more slowly are not real problems.</span>

		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1399">The answer can be found in our understanding of spacetime.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1400">Let's imagine the paths through spacetime taken by the twins, as measured using clocks and rulers at rest relative to the earth.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1401">The earthbound twin stays on the earth and consequently her path snakes along the time axis.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1409">Now just like distances in space, the length of two different paths in spacetime can be different.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1410">To reiterate, although everyone must agree on the length of any particular path through spacetime, the lengths of different paths need not be the same.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1411">This is really no different from saying that the distance from Chamonix to Courmayeur depends upon whether you went through the Mont Blanc tunnel or hiked over the Alps.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1412">Of course, walking over a mountain means you travel a longer distance than tunneling through it.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1413">In our discussion of the motorcyclist speeding over the spacetime landscape, we established that the time measured on the motorcyclist's wristwatch provides a direct way to measure the spacetime distance he traveled: we just need to multiply the elapsed time by c to get the spacetime distance.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1414">We can turn this statement on its head and say that once we know the spacetime distance traveled by each of the twins, then we can figure out the time that passes according to each.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1415">That is, we can think of each twin as a voyager through spacetime with their wristwatches measuring the spacetime distance that they travel.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1417">Now comes the key idea.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1418">Consider again at the formula for distances in spacetime, s<sup>2</sup>=(ct)<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup>.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1419">The spacetime distance is biggest if we can follow a path that has x = 0.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1420">Any other path must be shorter because we have to subtract the (always positive) x<sup>2</sup> contribution.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1421">But the earthbound twin snakes along the time direction with x close to zero, so her path must be the <i>longest possible path</i>.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1422">Actually, that is just another way of saying what we already know: that the earthbound twin is traveling as fast as possible through time and so it is she who ages the most.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1423">Our explanation so far has been presented from the viewpoint of the earthbound twin.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1424">To fully satisfy ourselves that there is no paradox, we should see how things look from the viewpoint of the astronaut twin.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1425">For her, the earthbound twin is the one doing the traveling while she snakes along her own time axis.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1426">It looks like the paradox is back again; since the astronaut twin is at rest relative to her spaceship, it seems that she should speed maximally through time and hence age the most.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1427">But there is a very subtle point here.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1428">The distance equation does <i>not</i> apply if we set out to use the astronaut twin's clocks and rulers to measure distances and times.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1429">More precisely, it fails when the astronaut twin undergoes the acceleration that turns the spaceship around.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1430">Why does it fail?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1431">The arguments we presented when we figured it out seemed pretty watertight.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1432">But if one uses an accelerating system of clocks and rulers to make measurements, as the astronaut twin must, then the assumption that spacetime is unchanging and the same everywhere that we used to write down the distance equation is wrong.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1433">Over the time of the acceleration, the astronaut twin will be pushed back into her seat, in much the same way that you are pushed back into your seat when you press the accelerator pedal on a car.</span>
		</p><span class="page-normal" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1434">100</span>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1435">For a start, that immediately picks out a special direction in space: the direction of the acceleration.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1436">The existence of that force must be accounted for in the distance equation, and that is where the loophole resides.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1437">It is a little too complicated for us to go into the mathematical details, but the upshot is that when the spaceship fires its rockets to turn around, the earthbound twin ages rapidly relative to the astronaut twin and that more than makes up for the fact that she ages more slowly during the nonaccelerating phases of the expedition.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1438">There is no paradox.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1439">We can't resist quoting some numbers, because the effect can be startling.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1440">Space travel is most comfortable for those onboard the spaceship if the rockets are firing in order to sustain an acceleration equal to "one g."</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1441">That means that the space travelers feel their own weight inside the rocket.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1442">So let's imagine a journey of 10 years at that acceleration, followed by 10 more years decelerating at the same rate, at which point we turn the spaceship around and head back to Earth, accelerating for 10 more years and decelerating for a further 10 before finally arriving back.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1443">In total the travelers onboard the spaceship will have been journeying for a total of 40 years.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1444">The question is how many years have passed on Earth?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1445">We'll just quote the result because the mathematics is (only a little) beyond the level of this book.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1446">The result is that a breathtaking 59,000 years will have passed on Earth!</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1447">This has been a remarkable journey, and we hope the listener has followed us into the world of spacetime.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1448">We are now ready to head directly to E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</span>

			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1450">Armed with spacetime and our invariant definition of distance, we ask a simple but very important question: Are there other invariant quantities that also describe the properties of real objects in the real world?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1451">Of course, distances aren't the only things that are important.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1452">Objects have mass, they can be hard or soft, hot or cold, solid, liquid, or gas.</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1453">Since all objects live in spacetime, is it possible to describe everything about the world in an invariant way?</span>
			<span class="sentence" id="dol_1_15_zujc_1454">We will discover in the next chapter that it is, and the consequences are profound, for this is the road that leads directly to E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</span>
